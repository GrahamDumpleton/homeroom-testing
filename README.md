To test this repository, you will need `kustomize` and `envsubst`.

First ensure you are logged in to your OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster
with cluster admin privileges.

Work out the cluster subdomain for ingress as you will need to substitute
it for `A.B.C.D.nip.io` in the following commands.

Then run:

```
kustomize build https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/homeroom-testing/learning-portal | CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN=A.B.C.D.nip.io envsubst '$CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN' | kubectl apply -f -
```

Access:

```
http://homeroom.A.B.C.D.nip.io
```

with whatever sub domain you specified.

To delete everything when done, run:

```
kustomize build https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/homeroom-testing/learning-portal | CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN=A.B.C.D.nip.io envsubst '$CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN' | kubectl delete -f -
```
